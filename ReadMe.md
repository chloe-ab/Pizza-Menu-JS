The pizza menu is a JavaScript application, utilizing jQuery, HTML and CSS.
			
The menu consists of radio buttons and check boxes.
Radio buttons allow for selection of pizza size, cheese, crust, and sauce; one button must be selected for each.
Check boxes allow for meat and veggie toppings; these are optional and multiple may be selected.
			
A pop-up window appears when the user clicks the "Review Order" button, containing a summary of the order: the items selected, the prices of each item, and the total price.
The price is calculated as follows:
The pizza size determines the base price.
Personal costs $6, medium costs $10, large costs $14, and extra large costs $16.

The first meat and the first veggie topping are each free, and then each additional topping is an additional $1.
Extra cheese is an additional $3 for any size pizza.
The cheese stuffed crust costs an additional $3, while the other crust types are complementary.
The sauce selection does not affect price; all are complimentary.
